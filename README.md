# 🍽️ Zomato Restaurant Clustering and Sentiment Analysis

This project is all about using machine learning to group similar Zomato restaurants together and understand what people are saying in their reviews.
We used clustering to find patterns in restaurant data, and sentiment analysis to check if reviews are positive or negative.

## 📂 Dataset
- `Zomato Restaurant Metadata.csv`
- `Zomato Restaurant Reviews.csv`

## 🧠 ML Pipeline
- Cleaned the data – removed missing values and unnecessary columns
- Preprocessed text reviews – removed stopwords, punctuation, and converted to lowercase
- Clustered restaurants using K-Means (unsupervised ML)
- Analyzed review sentiments using TF-IDF and ML models like Logistic Regression & Random Forest
- Engineered features to help models learn better
- Checked accuracy and improved models using hyperparameter tuning



## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, NLTK
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📈 Performance Metrics
- Accuracy, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix
- Cross-Validation & Hyperparameter Tuning


## 🧪 Colab Notebook
- You can run the notebook on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
