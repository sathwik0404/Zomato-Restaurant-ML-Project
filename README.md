# 🍽️ Zomato Restaurant Clustering and Sentiment Analysis

This project is all about using machine learning to group similar Zomato restaurants together and understand what people are saying in their reviews.
We used clustering to find patterns in restaurant data, and sentiment analysis to check if reviews are positive or negative.

## 📂 Dataset

- `Zomato Restaurant Reviews.csv`

## 🧠 ML Pipeline
- Data Cleaning and Exploration
- Textual Data Preprocessing (Tokenization, Lemmatization, etc.)
- Clustering using K-Means
- Sentiment Analysis using TF-IDF + Classification
- Feature Engineering & Selection
- Model Evaluation and Optimization (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, NLTK
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📈 Performance Metrics
- Accuracy, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix
- Cross-Validation & Hyperparameter Tuning


## 🧪 Colab Notebook
